# This is how you can create a checkbox

Checkboxes are created by using a hyphen - followed by square brackets [ ] with a "blank space" in between for empty checkboxes or with an "x" in between for checked boxes

# sample checkboxes
- [ ] empty
- [x] checked

especially for following up on issues this is helpful, see my example within the issues tab :)
